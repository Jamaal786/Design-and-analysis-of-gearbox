# Design and analysis of gearbox

## 📌 Overview
This was a university group project which involved the group to create a conveyor belt system for a production line. This project was designed by our course manager to simulate a realistic working world scenario as an engineer. Our team was given sepcifications and requirements to be met and catalogues to choose our parts from. My group decided to split the work amongst ourselves in order to meet the deadline and create an even workload. <br>

My portion of the project included : <br>
- Create a potential layout of the whole system
- Clutch and brake analysis
- 3D modelling of the gearbox housing
- checking calculations

## 🎯 Objectives
- The required output torque and speed of conveyor belt is met
- The gearbox can be manufactured without complications
- Drawings of parts were communicated effectively

## 🛠 Tools & Concepts Used
- Autodesk Inventor
- Mechanics of Materials
- Gear ratio calculations
- GD&T

## 🔍 Methodology
#### Layout
<br>
The main layout of the whole system was my task. I did some research on existsing systems, mainly vehicles, to see what would be the best way to layout the brakes, clutch and the gearbox. In the end, I found out that having the clutch before the gearbox would be the best course of action. If maintenence was needed on the gearbox or the brakes, the motor did not have to be stopped if the clutch was engaged. Furthermore, the brake was placed right next to the conveyor belt as it is the main component that must be stopped when the brake is applied.

#### Clutch and brake analysis
<br>
I leanrt about brake and clutch analysis in the lectures at university. However, as I used to be quite interested in cars back in highschool, I had a better understanding of these components compared to my peers. Therefore, I took up the clutch and brake analysis portion of the project. The calculations and decision process can be seen in the images portion of this repository. The diiffcult part in clutch and brake analysis was choosing the type of material for friction pads. I steered away from asbestos and from high end ceramic pads due to health and costs for production. I eventualy went for a kevlar/cast iron steel pad material due to a good temperature resistance, ability to resist crack and wear and the dry coefficient of friction was not too large, which would result in a smooth engagement. The brakes also used a non abestos organic material. This particular material would not be hazardous and be functional. The material chosen was also not expensive, which reduced costs in manufacturing and maintenence.

## 📊 Results

The result of this project was a success. We managed to find an appropriate gear ratio and selected gears, bearings and seals that fit. The gearbox housing was designed well, but the material reduction could be better. Unfortuantely, we did not learn how to design an effective gear box housing and proper CAD techinques for the gears and shafts due to a restriction of time. Regardless, the gearbox housing was still functional, and could hold all the components. In this project, we did not need to 3D model brakes and clutches in detail. However, the material selection and our process of choosing those materials were graded and approved by our lecturers. Below are the images from our project and some screenshots from my notebook.

### Notebook Images
The housing was modelled and designed by me. The shaft, gear and seal were designed by my groupmate. However, the drawing was drawn by me. The internal gearbox and gear layout was decided as a group, but included in this repository for overall understanding.
