# Design and analysis of gearbox

## 📌 Overview
This was a university group project which involved the group to create a conveyor belt system for a production line. This project was designed by our course manager to simulate a realistic working world scenario as an engineer. Our team was given sepcifications and requirements to be met and catalogues to choose our parts from. My group decided to split the work amongst ourselves in order to meet the deadline and create an even workload. <br>

My portion of the project included : <br>
- Create a potential layout of the whole system
- Clutch and brake analysis
- 3D modelling of the gearbox housing
- checking calculations

## 🎯 Objectives
- The required output torque and speed of conveyor belt is met
- The gearbox can be manufactured without complications
- Drawings of parts were communicated effectively

## 🛠 Tools & Concepts Used
- Autodesk Inventor
- Mechanics of Materials
- Gear ratio calculations
- GD&T

## 🔍 Methodology
#### Layout

#### Clutch and brake analysis

#### 3D modelling of the gearbox housing

#### Checking calculations


## 📊 Results

The result of this project was a success. We managed to find an appropriate gear ratio and selected gears, bearings and seals that fit. The gearbox housing was designed well, but the material reduction could be better. Unfortuantely, we did not learn how to design an effective gear box housing and proper CAD techinques for the gears and shafts due to a restriction of time. Regardless, the gearbox housing was still functional, and could hold all the components. In this project, we did not need to 3D model brakes and clutches in detail. However, the material selection and our process of choosing those materials were graded and approved by our lecturers. Below are the images from our project and some screenshots from my notebook.
