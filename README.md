# Design and analysis of gearbox

## 📌 Overview
This was a university group project which involved the group to create a conveyor belt system for a production line. This project was designed by our course manager to simulate a realistic working world scenario as an engineer. Our team were given sepcifications and requirements to be met and catalogues to choose our parts from. My group decided to split the work amongst ourselves in order to meet the deadline and create an even workload. <br>

My portion of the project included : <br>
- Create a potential layout of the whole system
- Clutch and brake analysis
- 3D modelling of the gearbox housing
- checking calculations

## 🎯 Objectives
- The required output torque and speed of conveyor belt is met
- The gearbox can be manufactured without complications
- Drawings of parts were communicated effectively

## 🛠 Tools & Concepts Used
- Autodesk Inventor
- Mechanics of Materials
