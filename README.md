# Design and analysis of gearbox

## 📌 Overview
This was a university group project which involved the group to create a conveyor belt system for a production line. This project was designed by our course manager to simulate a realistic working world scenario as an engineer. Our team was given sepcifications and requirements to be met and catalogues to choose our parts from. My group decided to split the work amongst ourselves in order to meet the deadline and create an even workload. <br>

My portion of the project included : <br>
- Create a potential layout of the whole system
- Clutch and brake analysis
- 3D modelling of the gearbox housing
- checking calculations

## 🎯 Objectives
- The required output torque and speed of conveyor belt is met
- The gearbox can be manufactured without complications
- Drawings of parts were communicated effectively

## 🛠 Tools & Concepts Used
- Autodesk Inventor
- Mechanics of Materials
- Gear ratio calculations
- GD&T

## 🔍 Methodology
#### Layout
The main layout of the whole system was my task. I did some research on existsing systems, mainly vehicles, to see what would be the best way to layout the brakes, clutch and the gearbox. In the end, I found out that having the clutch before the gearbox would be the best course of action. If maintenence was needed on the gearbox or the brakes, the motor did not have to be stopped if the clutch was engaged. Furthermore, the brake was placed right next to the conveyor belt as it is the main component that must be stopped when the brake is applied.

#### Clutch and brake analysis
I leanrt about brake and clutch analysis in the lectures at university. However, as I used to be quite interested in cars back in highschool, I had a better understanding of these components compared to my peers. Therefore, I took up the clutch and brake analysis portion of the project. The calculations and decision process can be seen in the images portion of this repository. The diiffcult part in clutch and brake analysis was choosing the type of material for friction pads. I steered away from asbestos and from high end ceramic pads due to health and costs for production. I eventualy went for a kevlar/cast iron steel pad material due to a good temperature resistance, ability to resist crack and wear and the dry coefficient of friction was not too large, which would result in a smooth engagement. The brakes also used a non abestos organic material. This particular material would not be hazardous and be functional. The material chosen was also not expensive, which reduced costs in manufacturing and maintenence.

#### 3D modelling of the gearbox housing and bottom plate
THe 3D modelling ang of the gearbox was my biggest ask in this project. It was the biggest time constraint we had as a group, and with little to no practice or tutorials on how to design a proper gearbox, it was a huge challenge for me. Personally, I found it difficult to understand how the bearings and seals would fit inside a gearbox, as I have never been exposed to it. There was a lot of on the job research and learning I had to do. Furthermore, my alignment of the openings and bearing supports could only begin after my groupmates had completed thier shaft modeling. Once all the shafts and components of the shafts were completed, I had to create sub assemblies of each shaft. I then created a new assembly which would finalise how the shafts would sit and thier postioning in the gearbox. Once the layout was completed and finalised with my team mates, I began the sketch and modelling of the gearbox.
<br>

The gearbox itself was very tricky as I had to think a few steps ahead on what things may need to be added as I went along. However, despite those counter measures, I had some mistakes which would be too difficult to fix, and I needed to restart the whole gearbox. However, with proper dimensions from the previous iteration, the process of making a new gearbox was quicker. This time, with proper CAD techniques, I managed to make a more stabile design which was also easier to edit. As I went along with making the gearbox body, I had to add in areas for the seals to sit flush against the body, bearing mounts for the bearings to sit, take into consideration for safety and chamfering edges, adding in M6 screw holes along the edges for sealing the top and bottom plates, while taking into consideration as to how the manufacturing process would be like. Before our final model, I had filetted all the edges so there would be no sharp edges. However, my group mate suggested to fillet them instead so that manufacturing would be quicker while incorporating non sharp edges. I agreed and filetted the edges for the final model. After everything was completed, I quickly drew up the motor and conveyor belt to get a layout of the full system.
<br>

Once the full system was created, I found out that the whole system was not aligned flat. To tackle this, I desined the base plate to have a bend so that it would allow the components to be aligned. I had to then figure out where all the bolt holes needed to be while deisgning the plate so components could attach to the plate. For th holes on te plate, we decided to make them slots so that there would be more adjustability and tolerances during assembly.
<br>

#### Checking calculations
While waiting for my groupmates to complete thier component selections and starts modelling the shafts and gears, I decided to help out by rechecking all our calculations to ensure we were on the right path. In the end, I found out that we did make a calculation error and we needed to change the number of gears we were using. The group appreciated my checks at it ensured that we did not proceed any further with wrong information.

## 📊 Results

The result of this project was a success. We managed to find an appropriate gear ratio and selected gears, bearings and seals that fit. The gearbox housing was designed well, but the material reduction could be better. Unfortuantely, we did not learn how to design an effective gear box housing and proper CAD techinques for the gears and shafts due to a restriction of time. Regardless, the gearbox housing was still functional, and could hold all the components. In this project, we did not need to 3D model brakes and clutches in detail. However, the material selection and our process of choosing those materials were graded and approved by our lecturers. Below are the images from our project and some screenshots from my notebook.

### Notebook Images
The housing was modelled and designed by me. The shaft, gear and seal were designed by my groupmate. However, the drawing was drawn by me. The internal gearbox and gear layout was decided as a group, but included in this repository for overall understanding.

## 📚 What I Learned

I learnt a lot in this project. I learnt how much I can learn from others and how rewarding it is to have a project just works. I also learnt how difficult it can be with bad communication and being unsure of certain things. However, my group ensured proper communication from the beginning. I realised my abilities in CAD improved alot more after this project. I learnt alot more CAD techinques from tutorials and online resources. I learnt alot of the manufacturing processes and techniques used in the industry and how my designs would affect the next stages of production. However, I still have alot to learn in this area and understand the best methods of designing for manufacture. I believe the improvement comes with experience and more exposure to different manufacturing methods and what works best in the products and materials being used. I could improve in my analyis and component choosing abilites as I did not do much of that in this project. I have little confidence in that area as I find it complicated and tough. However, it is  also a key component in design and analsysis and will be improving this area of my skillset by trying to do more of the component selection work in the next project.
